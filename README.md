The instructions to run this should be pretty easy:

This is assuming that you have all the packages installed that we've been using in this class (python, django, pip, etc.)

1. open a new terminal

2. cd into the folder for this project (/Tumblr)

3. execute 'python manage.py runserver'
    if this command does not work, try 'python3 manage.py runserver' instead

4. navigate to 'http://localhost:8000/' in your browser

5. You should now be able to navigate the webpage. The required blog post can be found at                           'http://localhost:8000/post/3'

Enjoy!
